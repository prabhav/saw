intro: "We are a team helping students settle in and help with the post landing needs.
  It can be stressful to start a new journey in\na new country but worry not we are
  your very own family in CANADA.\n\nWe are here to answer any question you might
  have regarding WHERE, HOW and WHEN to get things done.\n\nWe want students to SMOOTHLY
  transition into their new life. The aim is to provide a step by step plan for every
  student in order for them to thrive independently without risking their educational
  time. \nAll you need is to pack up your bags, arrive safely and the rest would be
  taken care of by us.\n\n"

testimonials:
- quote: 'I would, with all honestly and faith recommend SAW. I am so ever grateful
    to be connected with the organisation. It can be scary to move from your home
    country alone, but SAW has been with me throughout. As a matter of fact, they
    still guide me, have faith in me, and are like a family to me! I trust them fully,
    and recommend any student who is planning to come here, to get in contact with
    them! '
  author: "- Astha Chawla, Media Communication, Humber College 2018"
- quote: I am glad to be a part of such a great organisation. They helped me a lot
    during my initial days here in Canada and have continued to be like a family ever
    since. I know transitioning from your life back home to a new one can be difficult
    but SAW makes it much easier and helps you get settled in pretty quickly. They
    truly are your own family away from home and you can definitely count on them
    at every step of your journey.
  author: "- Shivangi Paul, Web Designing, CDI College 2019"
- quote: "Coming to a new country is more difficult than it sounds. Doing everything
    on your own, figuring out what is wrong and right. It gets overwhelming. I found
    SAW by randomly browsing through Facebook and I cannot thank them enough for everything
    they have done. From picking me up from the airport to helping me find housing
    which fits my budget and choice. \nIt is commendable to see how people in this
    country are helping each other grow."
