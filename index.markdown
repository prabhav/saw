testimonials:
- quote: 'I would, with all honestly and faith recommend SAW. I am so ever grateful
    to be connected with the organisation. It can be scary to move from your home
    country alone, but SAW has been with me throughout. As a matter of fact, they
    still guide me, have faith in me, and are like a family to me! I trust them fully,
    and recommend any student who is planning to come here, to get in contact with
    them! '
  author: "- Astha Chawla, Media Communication, Humber College 2018"
- quote: I am glad to be a part of such a great organisation. They helped me a lot
    during my initial days here in Canada and have continued to be like a family ever
    since. I know transitioning from your life back home to a new one can be difficult
    but SAW makes it much easier and helps you get settled in pretty quickly. They
    truly are your own family away from home and you can definitely count on them
    at every step of your journey.
  author: "- Shivangi Paul, Web Designing, CDI College 2019"
- quote: "Coming to a new country is more difficult than it sounds. Doing everything
    on your own, figuring out what is wrong and right. It gets overwhelming. I found
    SAW by randomly browsing through Facebook and I cannot thank them enough for everything
    they have done. From picking me up from the airport to helping me find housing
    which fits my budget and choice. \nIt is commendable to see how people in this
    country are helping each other grow."
  author: "- Shradha Chopra, Business Accounting, Humber College 2015"
- quote: 'When I decided Canada was the country I want to go to for my further education
    and started my research. I talked to hundreds of people,went to numerous student
    advisor but all of them provided limited services, limited to the extent of admission.
    I had no idea what will happen once I am there, what if I need someone , any help
    I had no idea. Someone suggested my SAW and that was the end of it. They provided
    me with a whole package and helped me with absolutely anything and everything.    '
  author: "- Shrey Mehta, Business Marketing Management, Conestoga College 2018"
- quote: My journey to and in Canada wouldn't have been possible without SAW help.
    I wouldn't have it any other way.
  author: "- Sameer Sachdeva, Business Accounting, Humber College 2018"
- quote: I was so confused what program to pick and what to do. I was wrongly advised
    from people I was in contact with until I met a SAW representative. They helped
    my journey more convenient and smooth.
  author: "- Shiven Sareen, International Business Management, George  Brown College
    2018"
- quote: Best advisor! Can't believe someone would go the extra mile to help someone
    like they did. Guess that's how Canadians are!
  author: Malaika Munjal, Business Economics Honours, University of Calgary 2018
- quote: From picking me from the airport to helping me find accomodation and a job
    they helped with that comes with settling in an unknown and new country. I couldn't
    be more satisfied.
  author: "- Yatin Syal, Massage Therapy, Humber College 2015"
- quote: I was more than confused about what I should do and how things will go in
    a new country. I am more than happy to have this family in Canada. They are my
    Home Away from Home!
