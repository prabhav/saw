Ontario is a large province. Temperatures vary from region to region. The temperature can be different within the same region. Usually, January is the coldest month of the year and July is the warmest. The northern part of the province has longer and colder winters than southern Ontario. Radio and TV news give temperatures in degrees Celsius (C). Sometimes they also give the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (F).
Ontario has 4 seasons:

**Spring: March 20 - June 20**
Spring is a rainy season in most of Ontario. Daytime temperatures rise throughout the season, but the nights are cool. The average temperature during the day is about 8°C in March, April and early May but it gets much cooler during the nights. Make sure you have an umbrella or a raincoat to stay dry.

**Summer: June 21 - September 21**
Summer begins on June 21 but, to most Ontarians, July and August are the main months of summer. In summer, the weather is very warm in most parts of the province. In southern Ontario, daytime temperatures are usually above 20°C and often rise above 30°C. It can be hot and very humid in the summer. On TV and radio you will hear warnings about health problems caused by heat, sun and smog. You should wear a hat and use some sunscreen to prevent sunburns.

**Fall (also called Autumn): September 22 - December 20**
Fall begins in September. The weather gets cool and the leaves on many trees change colour and fall to the ground. It can also be very rainy at this time of year. Make sure to carry an umbrella and a raincoat with you. In some northern parts of Ontario, it can snow in late October. In these months, the average daytime temperatures are about 10°C - 12°C in most of the province. The temperatures get lower as winter approaches.

**Winter: December 21 - March 19**
In winter, it is cold and snows often. During the winter months (December, January and February), the temperature in most of the province is usually below 0°C, day and night.Temperatures in some parts of the province can drop below -30°C. In most of Ontario, snow can be on the ground from the middle of December until the middle of March. In the northern parts of Ontario, the winter is longer and colder than in Southern Ontario. Make sure to wear layers and stay warm. Winters in Ontario can be very cold and snowy. If you come from a warm country, you might be surprised by how cold it can get. Winter is a time for fun in the snow, but it is important to learn about the dangers of the cold and how to stay warm. Here are some of the winter clothes you may need:
• Thick, windproof coat
• Scarf – for around your neck or across your face
• Gloves or mittens
• Warm underwear
• Winter hat that covers your ears
• Warm boots that are lined and/or waterproof

While it may be expensive to buy winter clothes when you arrive, remember that you will use what you buy to stay warm year after year.
You might also be able to buy gently used clothing at thrift stores for very reasonable prices. A thrift store is a store that has used goods that have been donated and is in good ![image.jpg](/uploads/image.jpg)![image.jpg](/uploads/image.jpg)enough condition to be reused.
